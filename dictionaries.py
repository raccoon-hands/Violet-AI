receive (Destination Port) data. In LAN switching, another term for switch interfaces appears.',\

'Positive Acknowledgment and Re-transmission':'A generic reference to how the error recovery feature works in many types of protocols, \

'Logical Address':'A generic reference to addresses as defined by Layer 3 protocols, which do not have to be concerned with \
the physical details of the underlying physical media. Used mainly to contrast these addresses with data-link addresses, \
which are generically considered to be physical addresses because they differ based on the type of physical medium.',\

for the classful network 10.0.0.0.',\

'Network Number/Address':'A number that uses dotted decimal notation like IP addresses, but the number itself represents \
all hosts in a single Class A, B, or C IP network.',\

'Routing Table':'A list of possible routes in a router, with each route listing the destination subnet and mask, the \
router interface out which to forward packets destined to that subnet, and, as needed, the next-hop router’s IP address.',\

'Back-to-back link':'This is a serial link between two routers, which is created without CSU/DSUs (Channel Service Units \
or Data Service Units, which are used as interface devices, similar to modems, to connect devices in a WAN). This link is \
created without any physical modem by connecting a DTE cable to one router and a DCE (Data Communications Equipment) cable \
to another router. Back-to-back links are typically used in labs to build serial links without the expense of leasing an \
existing phone line from a telephone company.',\

signal transitions in the transmitted signal, so that the receiving device can remain synchronized with the sending device.',\

'DTE':'Data Terminal Equipment. Converts user information into signals or reconverts information into signals. \
From a Layer 1 perspective however, the DTE synchronizes its clock based on the clock it was sent by the DCE. From a packet \
switching perspective, the DTE is considered the device that is outside the service provider’s network, and is typically a router.',\

'CSU/DSU':'Channel Service Unit and Data Service Units. A device that can understand the Layer 1 details of serial links installed \
by a telephone company and how to use a serial cable to communicate with networking equipment such as a router.',\

'DCE Layer 1':'DCE stands for Data Communications Equipment. From a physical layer perspective, the device providing the \

International Organization for Satndardization (ISO).',\

'Leased Line':'A serial communications circuit between two points, provided by some service provider, typically a \
telephone company (telco). Because the telco does not sell a physical cable between the two end points, instead of charging \
a monthly fee for the ability to send bits between the two sites, the service is considered as a leased service.',\

'Packet Switching':'A generic reference to network services, generally WAN services, in which the service examines the \
contents of the transmitted data to make some type of forwarding decision. This terms is mostly used to differentiate \
between the WAN term circuit switching in which the provider sets up a (Layer 1) circuit between two devices, and the \
provider makes no attempt to interpret the meaning of the bits exchanged.',\

transmit data with the pair of pins that are used to receive data on another device that is at the opposite end of the \
cable. In 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX networks, this cable swaps the pair at pins 1 and 2 to pins 3 and 6 on the \
other end of the cable, and vice versa.',\

'CSMA/CD':'A mechanism in which a device that is ready to transmit data first checks the data transfer channel if other \
data is being transferred across the channel, similar to a pedestrian checking the road to see if car is about to cross it. \
If no carrier is sensed for a specific time, the device can transmit (much like the pedestrian can cross a road if there is no\
car rushing toward him). If two devices transmit at once–like a pedestrian who crosses the road just as a car is driving by–a \
collision occurs. This collision is detected by all colliding devices and subsequently delays retransmissions from those devices \
for some random length of time, much like the accident creates a traffic jam that causes cars to slow down, even \
though they were not directly involved with the accident.',\

'Full Duplex':'Any communication in which two communicating devices can send and receive data. With regards to Ethernet \
LANs, this allows both devices to disable CSMA/CD logic. With a full duplex arrangement in traffic safety, the construction \
of an overhead pedestrian bridge on a highway would allow a pedestrian and a car to cross the road at the same time no matter what.',\

'Half Duplex':'Any communication in which only one device at a time can send data. In Ethernet LANs, this is considered the normal \
result of the CSMA/CD algorithm that enforces the rule of a device can send one thing at a time. Again, in terms of traffic safety, \
a half duplex is the result of a stop sign that only allows either the pedestrian or a car to cross the road, never both.',\

'Hub':'A LAN device that provides a centralized connection point for LAN cabling, which focuses on repeating any received electrical \
signal out all other ports, thereby creating a logical bus–tech speak for a common electrical path along which data can be sent \
from one computer to the other. This is similar to how a school bus works, which works as common path that picks up and drops off \
school kids at different bus stops.The hub, in the example of the school bus, would be the school the school kids are dropped off at.',\

'Pinout':'A description, either in words or pictures, how electronic signals are transmitted through each pin and receptacle in a \
connector, which connects the Ethernet cord to the computer.',\

'Protocol Type Field':'A field in the LAN header that identifies the type of header (aka the previous protocol used) that \
follows the initial LAN header. Protocol type fields include the DIX Ethernet Type field, the IEEE 802.2 DSAP field, \
and the SNAP protocol Type Field.',\

'Shared Ethernet':'An Ethernet that uses a hub, or even the original coaxial cabling (a cable which is used to transmit \
radio signals, but also works with Internet connections) to transmit data. This causes devices to take turns sending data, \
because they have to share the available bandwith along with all the other functions of the hub. An analogy that explains \
this is how a single narrow road is the only way into a village. Anything that wants to enter the village, be it a a \
delivery truck, a person on foot, or a bicycle, has to share that road in order to get to the village. These various \
modes of transport take different turns crossing the same road.',\

'Straight Through Cable':'In Ethernet, a cable that connects the wire to pin number 1, pin 2 on one end to pin 2 on \
the other. In general, this cable runs through the wire to connect the pins for both sending and receiving data.',\

'Switch':'A network device that filters, forwards, and floods Ethernet frames (aka data packets) \
based on the destination address of each frame.',\

'Switched Ethernet':'An Ethernet that uses a switch, not a hub, so that the devices connected to one switch port don’t have \
to use the bandwidth available on another port. Switched Ethernet provides more capacity than shared Ethernet. \
An example of this is the narrow road to a village being replaced with a series of roads for bikes, trucks, \
and pedestrians accordingly.',\

'Twisted Pair':'A transmission medium that consists of two insulated wires, with the wires twisted around each other in a \
spiral. An electrical circuit flows over the wire pair, with the current in opposite directions on each wire, \
which significantly reduces the interference between the two wires.',\
